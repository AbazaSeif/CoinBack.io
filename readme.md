## CoinBack.IO

**The biggest problem in the Bitcoin ecosystem is that not enough people have bitcoins.**

We need an easy and a simple way and preferably from a friendly trusted face for people to get bitcoins without wiring money to a remote nation, entering online credit card details and waiting a few days. Our experience has shown us that people are willing to pay a big premium to buy bitcoin in person, especially the first time. Merchants are always hungry for new profitable revenue streams as well. Coinback.io is a win for all parties and has evolved from nine months of working with retail merchants on Bitcoin adoption.

With coinback.io you can easily go to your favourite merchant and buy a small amount of bitcoins instantly. Merchants can acquire bitcoins by selling his products/services for bitcoin. Merchants bitcoins are not tied to the current bitcoin exchange rate, but have the average of the price he has acquired them at. So when a merchant sells his bitcoins he sees what is his average price and what is the current exchange price. Moreover he can decide premium on bitcoins he is selling. A merchant can send Bitcoin to a customer who has no wallet and thanks to the blockchain.info api we create him a new wallet on the fly.

**The merchant has made profit, a customer has just acquired bitcoin from a trusted local source, the ecosystem has grown and a new bitcoiner.**
